A web application that provides images and information about different dog and cat breeds so users can become better informed about breed standards and general characteristics. The goal of this application is for potential pet adopters to find breeds that match their personalities and lifestyle in hopes of cutting down on pet re-homing after adoption.

# How It Works
FurEver Home utilizes user input and jQuery Ajax calls to get information and images about cat and dog breeds from The Cat API and The Dog API. Once the Ajax call retrieves the specified data, the HTML is dynamically updated to display the image and information.
